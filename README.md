# **TextMagic** 

**TextMagic** is a PHP-based text analysis library designed to perform basic but powerful operations like text summarization, sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and text classification using simple algorithms such as Naive Bayes and TF-IDF. This library is designed for developers looking for a lightweight and efficient solution for text analysis tasks.

## **Features**

- **Text Summarization:** Extracts the most important sentences from a given text.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Detects whether the sentiment of the text is positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Keyword Extraction:** Finds the most frequent words in the text to highlight key concepts.
- **Text Classification:** Classifies the text into categories like "news", "sports", and "entertainment."

## **Installation**

To install **TextMagic**, run the following command:

```bash
composer require fathkoc/php-textmagic
```

## **Usage**

### 1. **Text Summarization**

This feature allows you to summarize the text by selecting the most relevant sentences.

```php
use TextMagic\TextAnalyzer;

$analyzer = new TextAnalyzer();
$text = "This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence. This is the third sentence.";

echo $analyzer->summarize($text, 2);  // Will return the top 2 sentences.
```

### 2. **Sentiment Analysis**

Analyzes the sentiment of the text and returns whether it's positive, negative, or neutral.

```php
$sentiment = $analyzer->sentimentAnalysis("I love this! It makes me happy.");
echo $sentiment;  // Will return 'positive'.
```

### 3. **Keyword Extraction**

Extracts the top 5 keywords from a text.

```php
$keywords = $analyzer->extractKeywords("Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science.");
print_r($keywords);  // Will return an array of the most frequent words.
```

### 4. **Text Classification**

Classifies the text into one of the predefined categories using a Naive Bayes classifier.

```php
$category = $analyzer->classify("The football match was exciting.");
echo $category;  // Will return the predicted category (e.g., 'sports').
```

## **How It Works**

- **Text Summarization:** Uses the TF-IDF algorithm to weigh each sentence's importance based on the words it contains.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Uses a simple keyword matching system with predefined positive and negative words.
- **Keyword Extraction:** Tokenizes the text and counts the frequency of each word to return the most frequent ones.
- **Text Classification:** Uses a Naive Bayes classifier to predict the category of the text based on training data.

## **Limitations**

While **TextMagic** provides useful insights from text, it uses basic algorithms and techniques that are not powered by advanced AI or machine learning models. Itâ€™s ideal for lightweight applications but may not provide the accuracy of more complex NLP models.
